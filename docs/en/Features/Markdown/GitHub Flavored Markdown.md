Obsidian's Markdown dialect, called [[en/Features/Markdown/Obsidian Flavored Markdown|Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM)]], is based on another dialect called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
GFM is based on CommonMark, and has additional syntax extension and undocumented widgets that abuses existing Markdown syntax.

## Unsupported features

### Alerts

This feature is not officially documented at the specification.

- [Basic writing and formatting syntax - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts)

Syntax-wise, a valid GFM Alert is a valid OFM Callout: <math><mi>Alert</mi><mo>âŠ‚</mo><mi>Callout</mi></math>.
However, the `CAUTION` type will be rendered as same variant as `WARNING` type, as shown below.

```markdown
> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

### MermaidJS diagrams

This feature is not officially documented at the specification.

- [Creating diagrams - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

Due to the library neither be able to output without headless Chrome/Chromium nor exposes syntax parser, Macana does not support for this feature currently.

### Mathematical expressions

This feature is not officially documented at the specification.

- [Writing mathematical expressions - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)

OFM defines [its own syntax for mathematical expressions](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Advanced+formatting+syntax#Math).
While both OFM and GFM use dollar sign as a marker, GFM also supports an alternative syntax for inline mathematical expression:

```markdown
Answer is $`x = 5`$.
```

Macana does not support this alternative syntax.
