Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM) is an authoring format used in Obsidian, based on CommonMark and [[GitHub Flavored Markdown]] (GFM).
This page lists extensions not exists in both CommonMark and GFM.

Unfortunately, Obsidian does not publish a formal spec for the OFM.
Users should be aware Macana's OFM parser is not guaranteed to be 100% compatible with Obsidian's one, as the spec is not defined and even Obsidian behave inconsistent in some area.
